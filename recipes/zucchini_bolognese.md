# Zucchini Bolognese

This recipe is really good - low calorie and tastes exactly like normal spaghetti bolognese

## Ingredients

- Zucchini
- Low fat mince
- Crushed tomatoes
- Mushrooms
- Spices of choice
- Cheese

## Instructions

Pretty much throw all your ingredients (minus the zucchini) into a pan and heat until mince is cooked. Peel and discard the outside of the zucchini, but use the peeler on the rest to make long, flat strands (like pasta). Once you have enough zucchini strands to your liking, add the mince mixture on top.
