# Engineering

Developing your engineering career can be overly simplified to 2 main categories

- Technical ability
- Communication

## Technical ability

**Ability to write maintainable, readable, scalable code.**

## Communication

**Ability to express and communicate ideas, tasks and plans to the team**

NOTE: This has been a struggle point for me as I've seldom planned or taken team input on my technical decisions.
