# Ant Colony Optimization

Really interesting approach to aproximating the the solution in shortest path type problems. Works by simulating an ants behaviour in finding food where it will recursively travel to the closest node in a given problem finding a very approximated solution. The real interesting part is when many of these ants are simulated and a 'pheremone' is introduced when a path is continually taken by the ants (it being continually taken meaning it is most likely the optimal route). Other ants will prefer to use paths with stronger pheremones (similar to real ants).
